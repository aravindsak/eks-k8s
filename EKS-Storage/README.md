# EBS Storage

This YAML file describes a Kubernetes StorageClass resource for the EBS CSI driver. Let's break down each step:

# Storage Class in Kubernetes

## Introduction

In Kubernetes (K8s), a storage class is an object that defines the storage requirements for persistent volumes (PVs) used by pods. It provides a way to dynamically provision storage resources on-demand in a cluster.

Storage classes abstract the underlying storage infrastructure, allowing administrators to define different classes based on the performance, availability, or other characteristics of the storage they provide. These classes enable developers to request and use persistent storage without needing detailed knowledge about the underlying infrastructure.

## How it Works

1. **Storage Class Creation**: The administrator creates one or more storage classes, specifying the necessary parameters and provisioner information. A provisioner is responsible for creating and managing the underlying storage resources.

2. **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**: Developers reference the storage class in their pod specification by creating a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC). The PVC requests a specific amount of storage and references the desired storage class.

3. **PV Matching**: When the pod is created, the Kubernetes control plane checks for an available PV that matches the requested storage class and capacity defined in the PVC.

4. **Dynamic Provisioning**: If a suitable PV doesn't exist, the storage class provisions a new PV dynamically based on the defined parameters.

5. **PV and PVC Binding**: The PV is bound to the PVC, making it available for use by the pod. The pod can then mount the persistent volume and use it for storing data.

## StorageClass 

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: ebs-sc
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

**apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1:** Specifies the API version for the StorageClass resource.

**kind: StorageClass:** Defines the Kubernetes resource type as a StorageClass.

**metadata:** Contains metadata information about the StorageClass.

**name: ebs-sc:** Specifies the name of the StorageClass as "ebs-sc".
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com: Indicates the provisioner responsible for provisioning the persistent volumes. In this case, the EBS CSI driver with the provisioner name "ebs.csi.aws.com" will handle the creation and management of EBS volumes.

**volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer:** Defines the binding mode for the volumes created by this StorageClass. The "WaitForFirstConsumer" mode means that the volume will be provisioned when the first pod using it is scheduled.

Overall, this YAML file sets up a StorageClass named "ebs-sc" that uses the EBS CSI driver provisioner. It specifies that the volume binding should wait until the first consumer (pod) is scheduled before provisioning the volume.

# Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) 

A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is a Kubernetes resource used to request storage resources from a storage provider in a cluster. PVCs are used to dynamically provision and manage Persistent Volumes (PVs) in Kubernetes. PVs represent actual storage resources such as disks, volumes, or network storage.

To create a PVC, you need to define a YAML file that describes the PVC object. Here's an example of a basic PVC definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```
In this example, the PVC is named "my-pvc" and requests 10 gigabytes of storage. The accessModes field specifies the desired access mode for the PVC, which can be ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany, or ReadWriteMany, indicating whether the volume can be accessed by a single node, multiple nodes, or in read-only mode.

# ConfigMap

An EKS ConfigMap is a Kubernetes resource used to store non-sensitive configuration data that can be consumed by applications running on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). ConfigMaps are key-value pairs and provide a way to decouple configuration data from the application code, allowing for easier management and modification of configuration settings without redeploying the application.

To create an EKS ConfigMap, you need to define a YAML file that describes the ConfigMap object. Here's an example of a basic ConfigMap definition:

```yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-configmap
data:
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
```
In this example, the ConfigMap is named "my-configmap" and contains two key-value pairs: "key1" with the value "value1" and "key2" with the value "value2". You can add more key-value pairs as needed.

To create the ConfigMap using the YAML file, you can use the kubectl command-line tool or apply the YAML directly to your EKS cluster. Here's an example of using kubectl:

shell
Copy code
kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml
Replace configmap.yaml with the path to your ConfigMap YAML file.

Once the ConfigMap is created, applications running in the EKS cluster can access the configuration data by referencing the keys defined in the ConfigMap. For example, an application can read the value of "key1" by accessing the environment variable MY_CONFIGMAP_NAMESPACE_key1.

You can also mount the ConfigMap as a volume in a container and read the configuration data from files. This allows for more flexibility in how applications consume the ConfigMap data.
