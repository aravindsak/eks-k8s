# EBS CSI Driver StorageClass YAML

This YAML file describes a Kubernetes StorageClass resource for the EBS CSI driver. Let's break down each step:

## YAML File Content

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: ebs-sc
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

**apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1:** Specifies the API version for the StorageClass resource.

**kind: StorageClass:** Defines the Kubernetes resource type as a StorageClass.

**metadata:** Contains metadata information about the StorageClass.

**name: ebs-sc:** Specifies the name of the StorageClass as "ebs-sc".
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com: Indicates the provisioner responsible for provisioning the persistent volumes. In this case, the EBS CSI driver with the provisioner name "ebs.csi.aws.com" will handle the creation and management of EBS volumes.

**volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer:** Defines the binding mode for the volumes created by this StorageClass. The "WaitForFirstConsumer" mode means that the volume will be provisioned when the first pod using it is scheduled.

Overall, this YAML file sets up a StorageClass named "ebs-sc" that uses the EBS CSI driver provisioner. It specifies that the volume binding should wait until the first consumer (pod) is scheduled before provisioning the volume.
