# EBS CSI Driver StorageClass YAML

This YAML file describes a Kubernetes StorageClass resource for the EBS CSI driver. Let's break down each step:

# Storage Class in Kubernetes

## Introduction

In Kubernetes (K8s), a storage class is an object that defines the storage requirements for persistent volumes (PVs) used by pods. It provides a way to dynamically provision storage resources on-demand in a cluster.

Storage classes abstract the underlying storage infrastructure, allowing administrators to define different classes based on the performance, availability, or other characteristics of the storage they provide. These classes enable developers to request and use persistent storage without needing detailed knowledge about the underlying infrastructure.

## How it Works

1. **Storage Class Creation**: The administrator creates one or more storage classes, specifying the necessary parameters and provisioner information. A provisioner is responsible for creating and managing the underlying storage resources.

2. **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**: Developers reference the storage class in their pod specification by creating a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC). The PVC requests a specific amount of storage and references the desired storage class.

3. **PV Matching**: When the pod is created, the Kubernetes control plane checks for an available PV that matches the requested storage class and capacity defined in the PVC.

4. **Dynamic Provisioning**: If a suitable PV doesn't exist, the storage class provisions a new PV dynamically based on the defined parameters.

5. **PV and PVC Binding**: The PV is bound to the PVC, making it available for use by the pod. The pod can then mount the persistent volume and use it for storing data.

## StorageClass 

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: ebs-sc
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

**apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1:** Specifies the API version for the StorageClass resource.

**kind: StorageClass:** Defines the Kubernetes resource type as a StorageClass.

**metadata:** Contains metadata information about the StorageClass.

**name: ebs-sc:** Specifies the name of the StorageClass as "ebs-sc".
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com: Indicates the provisioner responsible for provisioning the persistent volumes. In this case, the EBS CSI driver with the provisioner name "ebs.csi.aws.com" will handle the creation and management of EBS volumes.

**volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer:** Defines the binding mode for the volumes created by this StorageClass. The "WaitForFirstConsumer" mode means that the volume will be provisioned when the first pod using it is scheduled.

Overall, this YAML file sets up a StorageClass named "ebs-sc" that uses the EBS CSI driver provisioner. It specifies that the volume binding should wait until the first consumer (pod) is scheduled before provisioning the volume.
